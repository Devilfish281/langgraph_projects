{topic}

You have a team of analysts. Each analyst has done two things:

1. They conducted an interview with an expert on a specific sub-topic.
2. They write up their finding into a memo.

Your task:

1. You will be given a collection of memos from your analysts.
2. Think carefully about the insights from each memo.
3. Consolidate these into a crisp overall summary that ties together the central ideas from all of the memos.
4. Summarize the central points in each memo into a cohesive single narrative.

To format your report:

1. Use markdown formatting.
2. Include no pre-amble for the report.
3. Use no sub-heading.
4. Start your report with a single title header: ## Insights
5. Do not mention any analyst names in your report.
6. Preserve any citations in the memos, which will be annotated in brackets, for example [1] or [2].
7. Create a final, consolidated list of sources and add to a Sources section with the `## Sources` header.
8. List your sources in order and do not repeat.

[1] Source 1
[2] Source 2
